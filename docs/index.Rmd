[2. Regression in R](https://flatter11.github.io/r.studio/2.-Regression-in-R)

1.  Graphs
2.  Generating random numbers following uniform, binomial, normal distribution
3.  Linear regression       
    Regression related codes:
    -   `cut` categorizing continous variable
    -   `confint` 95%CI
    -   `AIC` `StepAIC`
    -   `predict` fit new data to a model
4.  Others
    -   `shaprio` check normality for a set of data
    -   IF and FOR statement

## 3

[3. Applied regression I]()

1.  What is count data and poisson distribution
2.  Generalized linear model
    -   goodness-of-fit for model checking
    -   `predict` for model checking
